## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Myself Mahesh Mavuri, writing some blogs to help my fellow developers. You can view this better [here](https://mahesh-mavuri.github.io/Mahesh-Mavuri/) if visiting in github.

Here are some of the blogs on my areas of interest. I have used AI to write these but I can assure that these are validated and tested. Main intention is to document the aspects that I am exploring and documenting for quick reference.

[Mastering JWT Authorization in .NET Core: A Comprehensive Tutorial](https://mahesh-mavuri.github.io/JWTSelfAuth/) - This tutorial explains to create jwt based authentication and authorization with the role based authorization and policy based authorization.
